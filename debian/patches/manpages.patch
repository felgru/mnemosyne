+.TH MNEMOSYNE 1 "" "Mnemosyne" "Spaced Repetition Flash-card Program"
+.SH NAME
+mnemosyne \- spaced repetition flash-card program
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B mnemosyne
+.RI [ options ]
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+The Mnemosyne software resembles a traditional flash-card program to help you
+memorise question/answer pairs, but with an important twist: it uses a
+sophisticated algorithm to schedule the best time for an item to come up for
+review. Difficult items that you tend to forget quickly will be scheduled more
+often, while Mnemosyne won't waste your time on things you remember well.
+
+Since Mnemosyne is a GUI application it is usually not started from a shell,
+but from an X11 menu and doesn't take many options. For a few hints on how to
+use the software, see the homepage at http://www.mnemosyne-proj.org
